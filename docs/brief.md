## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Service-based businesses face significant barriers to establishing effective online presence:

1. **High Development Costs:** Custom website development from agencies costs $5,000-$50,000, prohibitively expensive for small businesses with limited marketing budgets.

2. **Complex DIY Builders:** Existing website builders (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress) overwhelm non-technical users with design decisions, plugin management, and technical configuration requirements.

3. **SEO Knowledge Gap:** Small business owners lack expertise to optimize content for local search, missing critical opportunities to attract customers via Google search.

4. **Time-Consuming Content Creation:** Writing effective website copy, service descriptions, and marketing content requires skills many business owners don't possess.

5. **Ongoing Maintenance Burden:** Keeping websites updated, secure, and optimized requires continuous technical attention that diverts focus from core business operations.

### Impact of the Problem

- **Lost Revenue:** Businesses without professional websites lose 60-80% of potential customers who research services online before calling
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Competitors with optimized websites capture local search traffic and online leads
- **Brand Perception:** Outdated or unprofessional websites damage credibility and trust with potential customers
- **Inefficient Operations:** Manual website updates consume 5-10 hours per month of valuable business owner time

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current alternatives present critical limitations:

- **Traditional DIY Builders:** Require significant time investment (20-40 hours) to learn platform and create initial site
- **Template Marketplaces:** Static templates lack industry-specific optimization and require technical customization
- **Managed Services:** Monthly costs of $200-$500+ are unsustainable for small businesses
- **No AI Integration:** Existing platforms lack intelligent content optimization and SEO assistance

### Urgency and Importance

The shift to digital-first customer acquisition accelerated dramatically post-2020. Service businesses without strong online presence face existential threat as younger demographics (Millennials, Gen Z) rely exclusively on online research for service provider selection. **The window to capture market share in the small business website builder space is narrowing as larger platforms (WordPress, Wix) expand downmarket.**

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Multi-Tenant Website Rendering:** Dynamic page rendering system that loads tenant-specific content, branding, and configuration from JSON data storage. URL structure: `/tenant/[tenantId]/[slug]`. **Rationale:** Foundation of entire platform—without this, no tenant websites can be served.

- **Section-Based Page Builder:** Pre-built page sections (Hero, Features, Services, About, Contact, Footer, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ) that compose into complete pages. Minimum 10 section types required. **Rationale:** Core value proposition of rapid website creation depends on reusable, professionally designed sections.

- **Real-Time Inline Editing:** Edit mode activated via `?edit=true` query parameter enabling direct content editing with save functionality via `/api/save-content`. **Rationale:** Differentiator from competitors—eliminates confusing admin interface and provides instant visual feedback.

- **Dynamic Navigation Management:** Edit navigation menu items, add/delete/reorder pages, persist changes to `header.json` with validation (max 10 items, no duplicate slugs). **Rationale:** Essential for multi-page websites and business requirement for showcasing multiple service offerings.

- **Dynamic Branding System:** Apply custom colors (primary, secondary, accent), fonts (heading, body), logo, and favicon per tenant using CSS custom properties. **Rationale:** Business differentiation requires unique visual identity—generic templates won't meet market expectations.

- **SEO Metadata Management:** Per-page SEO settings (meta title, description, keywords) with character validation and social media tags (Open Graph, Twitter Card). **Rationale:** Search engine visibility is critical success factor for service businesses—poor SEO = platform failure.

- **AI Content Optimization:** Basic AI-powered content improvement suggestions and SEO metadata generation with industry-specific optimization. Current heuristic implementation ready for LLM integration. **Rationale:** Key differentiator and value-add that justifies subscription pricing vs. free/low-cost alternatives.

- **Business Owner Dashboard:** Central hub showing website statistics, quick access to edit website, view performance metrics, and manage account settings. **Rationale:** Business owners need clear ROI visibility and easy access to management functions.

- **Customer Sign-Up Flow:** Multi-step onboarding collecting business information, service offerings, template selection, contact details, and payment information. **Rationale:** Automated customer acquisition requires self-service signup without sales team involvement.

- **Domain Management:** Support for custom domains and subdomain-based tenant routing via lookup system mapping domains to tenant IDs. **Rationale:** Professional websites require custom domains (mybusiness.com vs. generic siteninja.io/mybusiness).

- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** All section components and pages render correctly on mobile devices using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities. **Rationale:** 60%+ of website traffic comes from mobile—non-responsive sites are dealbreaker for customers.

- **Contact Form Functionality:** Working contact forms that capture customer inquiries and send notifications to business owner email. **Rationale:** Lead generation is primary business objective—broken contact forms = platform failure.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- E-commerce functionality and payment processing for end-customer transactions
- Blog/content management system with rich text editing
- Multi-location business support with location-specific pages
- Advanced analytics and conversion tracking beyond basic metrics

- Team collaboration features (comments, approvals, version history)
- Template marketplace and custom template creation tools
- White-label/agency reseller functionality
- Multi-language/internationalization support
- Advanced integrations (Zapier, CRM systems, marketing automation)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android) for website management
- Live chat widget and customer communication tools
- Appointment scheduling and booking functionality
- Email marketing and newsletter campaigns
- Advanced SEO features (schema markup customization, sitemap generation, robots.txt)

### MVP Success Criteria

**The MVP will be considered successful when:**

1. **10 Pilot Customers:** Successfully onboard 10 real service businesses (not test accounts) who publish live websites and maintain active subscriptions for 90+ days

2. **Website Launch Speed:** 80%+ of pilot customers publish first website within 60 minutes of signup (target: 30 minutes, acceptable: 60 minutes)

3. **Content Update Frequency:** Pilot customers edit website content average 2+ times per month, indicating ongoing engagement and value perception

4. **Lead Generation Validation:** At least 50% of pilot customers report receiving customer inquiries via website contact forms within 60 days of launch

5. **System Reliability:** Platform maintains 99%+ uptime during pilot period with zero data loss incidents

6. **Customer Satisfaction:** Net Promoter Score of 40+ among pilot customers with 70%+ saying they would recommend to peers

7. **Technical Validation:** Successfully support 10 concurrent tenants with page load times <2 seconds and no cross-tenant data leakage

**Success means proceeding to full launch; failure criteria triggering pivot or major iteration would be <5 pilot customers, <50% website publication rate, or NPS <20.**

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded MVP development with <$5,000 infrastructure costs through first 100 customers. Assumes free/low-cost tiers of hosting (Vercel), database (Supabase free tier or local PostgreSQL), and development tools.

- **Timeline:** MVP launch target within 3-6 months from current state (as of October 2025). Key milestone: Pilot customer onboarding by December 2025. Full public launch by Q1 2026.

- **Resources:**
  - Single full-stack developer for MVP (current developer)
  - Part-time design support for template creation and UI/UX refinement
  - No dedicated QA/testing resources (developer-led testing)
  - No marketing budget until post-MVP validation

- **Technical:**
  - File-based storage limits to 100-500 tenants maximum (database migration required for scale)
  - No real-time collaboration during MVP (single-user editing only)
  - AI features limited to heuristic implementation until budget allows LLM API costs
  - Image hosting via public folder (no CDN) during MVP
  - No custom domain SSL provisioning during MVP (subdomain-only)

### Key Assumptions

- **Market Demand:** Service-based businesses are willing to pay $49-99/month for website solution that delivers measurable lead generation and saves 5+ hours per month vs. DIY alternatives

- **Customer Behavior:** Target customers prefer guided template-based approach over blank canvas creative freedom and value speed-to-launch over infinite customization options

- **Competitive Position:** Established players (Wix, Squarespace) are over-serving small service businesses with features they don't need, creating opportunity for focused, simpler solution

- **Technical Feasibility:** File-based JSON storage is sufficient for MVP and first 100 customers without significant performance degradation, enabling database migration to be deferred until product-market fit validated

- **AI Value Proposition:** Content optimization and SEO suggestions provide sufficient value even with heuristic implementation; customers will perceive AI assistance as valuable differentiator

- **Acquisition Channels:** Target customers can be reached via Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram ads, and trade association partnerships with CAC <$150 per customer

- **Retention Drivers:** Once customers invest time in website setup and begin receiving leads, switching costs (time to rebuild elsewhere) create strong retention moat

- **Development Velocity:** Single developer can maintain MVP, onboard pilot customers, and iterate based on feedback while developing Phase 2 features in parallel

- **Payment Friction:** Credit card payment is acceptable barrier; customers don't require invoicing, purchase orders, or enterprise sales process

- **Support Burden:** Self-service documentation, video tutorials, and email support (<24 hour response) sufficient for first 100 customers without live chat or phone support

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Market Saturation Risk:** Website builder market is highly competitive with entrenched players (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress) who have massive marketing budgets and brand recognition. **Impact: HIGH.** Mitigation: Focus on service business vertical specialization, superior onboarding experience, and AI differentiation rather than competing head-to-head on features.

- **Customer Acquisition Cost Risk:** Cost to acquire customers via paid advertising may exceed $150 target, making unit economics unsustainable. **Impact: HIGH.** Mitigation: Develop organic acquisition channels (SEO, content marketing, partnerships with trade associations) to reduce dependence on paid ads. Implement referral program with incentives.

- **Technical Scalability Risk:** File-based architecture may break down before reaching 100 customers if usage patterns (high edit frequency, large media files) differ from assumptions. **Impact: MEDIUM.** Mitigation: Monitor performance metrics closely, prepare database migration plan as fallback, implement caching and optimization as stopgaps.

- **AI Cost Risk:** If real LLM integration happens before sufficient revenue, API costs ($0.01-0.10 per optimization) could consume 20-30% of revenue. **Impact: MEDIUM.** Mitigation: Implement usage limits (5-10 AI optimizations per month per customer), offer AI features as premium add-on, negotiate volume pricing with providers.

- **Feature Creep Risk:** Customer requests for additional features (e-commerce, bookings, CRM) may distract from core website builder value proposition and dilute product focus. **Impact: MEDIUM.** Mitigation: Maintain strict prioritization discipline, validate feature requests with multiple customers before building, consider partnership integrations over native development.

- **Quality vs. Speed Tradeoff:** Pressure to launch quickly may result in bugs, performance issues, or poor UX that damage early customer perception and retention. **Impact: MEDIUM.** Mitigation: Structured pilot phase with forgiving early adopters, proactive communication about MVP status, rapid bug fix cycle.

- **Founder Burnout Risk:** Single developer wearing all hats (development, support, marketing, sales) is unsustainable beyond first 50-100 customers. **Impact: MEDIUM.** Mitigation: Plan for early hire (customer success/support role) once MRR reaches $5K, automate repetitive tasks, build self-service resources.

### Open Questions

- **Pricing Model:** Should we offer tiered pricing (Basic $49, Pro $99, Enterprise $199) or single-tier initially? What features justify price differentiation?

- **Template Strategy:** How many industry-specific templates needed to capture majority of target market? Is 10-15 industry templates sufficient or do we need 50+?

- **Custom Domain Timeline:** When should we enable custom domain support? Is subdomain-only acceptable for pilot phase (mybusiness.siteninja.io)?

- **AI Feature Discoverability:** Will customers discover and use AI optimization features without explicit prompting? Do we need onboarding nudges or UI hints?

- **Target Industry Priority:** Which service industry should we focus on first? Plumbing, HVAC, IT consulting, legal services? Does specialization matter or should we stay horizontal?

- **Partnership vs. Build:** Should we build native features (scheduling, payments, reviews) or integrate with established platforms (Calendly, Stripe, Podium)?

- **Support Model Sustainability:** At what customer count does email-only support become unmanageable? Is live chat required earlier than anticipated?

- **Freemium vs. Paid-Only:** Should we offer free tier with limited features to drive acquisition, or require payment from day one to filter serious customers?

- **Mobile App Priority:** How important is mobile app for on-the-go website editing vs. responsive web interface? Does lack of app hurt conversion?

- **Geographic Focus:** Should we target specific geographic regions (e.g., US only) initially or launch globally? Does local SEO focus require geographic specialization?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Competitive Pricing Analysis:** Detailed survey of competitor pricing (Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy Website Builder, WordPress hosting) and feature comparison to determine optimal positioning

  - Custom development: $5,000-$50,000 one-time

**User Feedback (Informal):**

- 5 preliminary interviews with service business owners (plumbing, HVAC, IT) conducted September-October 2025:
  - 4 of 5 expressed frustration with current website solutions
  - All 5 stated they would pay $49-79/month for solution that "just works"
  - 3 of 5 actively interested in pilot program
  - Key quotes: "I don't have time to become a web designer" | "I just need something professional that shows up on Google" | "Can you make it so I don't have to call my nephew every time I want to change something?"

### B. Stakeholder Input

**Development Team Perspective:**

- Current architecture well-suited for MVP and early scale (up to 500 tenants)
- Database migration should happen by 100-200 active tenants for safety margin
- AI integration ready from technical standpoint; cost/benefit analysis needed before activating
- Image upload and optimization is most-requested missing feature from technical perspective
- Mobile responsiveness solid but needs dedicated testing across devices

**Advisor/Mentor Feedback:**

- Focus recommendation: "Don't try to compete with Wix on features—compete on simplicity and results"
- Pricing guidance: "Charge more than you think you should; $99/month is not unreasonable if you deliver leads"
- Go-to-market strategy: "Partner with one trade association (plumbers, electricians) and dominate that vertical first"

### PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for **SiteNinja**, a multi-tenant website builder platform for service-based businesses. The platform is currently in advanced MVP stage with core functionality implemented and ready for pilot customer testing.

**Critical Context for Product Management:**

- **Current State:** MVP is 80% complete with functional multi-tenant rendering, inline editing, SEO management, and AI-ready architecture. Major gaps: authentication, payment integration, database migration.

- **Target Market:** Small service businesses (plumbing, HVAC, IT consulting) with 1-20 employees seeking professional online presence without technical complexity or high costs.

- **Value Proposition:** Fastest time-to-professional-website (30 minutes vs. 10-20 hours), AI-powered content optimization, and real-time inline editing at $49-99/month price point.

- **Immediate Priorities:**
  1. Complete authentication and payment systems (blockers for launch)
  2. Recruit 10 pilot customers to validate product-market fit
  3. Database migration to enable scaling beyond 100 tenants
  4. Build customer support infrastructure and documentation

**Please start in 'PRD Generation Mode'** if applicable, or proceed with sprint planning to execute the 10 immediate actions listed above. Review this brief thoroughly and request any necessary clarification or suggest improvements based on product management expertise.

**Key Questions for PM Consideration:**
- Should we pursue freemium model or paid-only from day one?
- Which service industry vertical should we focus on first?
- Is $49-99/month pricing optimal or should we test higher price points?
- Timeline for pilot program launch: 30 days achievable or 60 days more realistic?

**Document Status:** Draft v1.0 - Ready for review and iteration
**Next Review:** After pilot customer feedback (estimated Q1 2026)
**Owner:** Development Team / Product Management (TBD)
